## Notes for Master Document of Resume

- Create csv file to draw information from for common_variables.R (and parsing_functions.R?)

- On this same note: 
  * Create relational database for work history elements: 
    > Employers - employer information 
    > Posiitions - as associated with employers 
    > Skills - as associated with positions (either as a long data frame or a JSON file?) 
    > This can be showcased as a project.
