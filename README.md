## My Resume

This repo contains the source code for [my resume](https://github.com/uberkeil/kyle_CV/blob/master/KyleSimpson_Resume.pdf), which was built in  [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) using [Nick Strayer's](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/) data driven CV paradigm. The files
for this build were actually copied from his [cv](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) repository prior to the release of his [datadrivencv](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) package.
