## My Resume

This repo contains the source code for my resume, which was built in  [pagedown](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) using [Nick Strayer's](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/) data driven CV paradigm. The files
for this build were actually copied from his [cv](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) repository prior to the release of his [datadrivencv](i  i   tps://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) package.
